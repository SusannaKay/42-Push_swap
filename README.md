# Push_swap  
Sorting algorithm challenge using two stacks and limited instructions, built in C at 42 Roma Luiss.

## What it does  
- Accepts a list of integers as input.  
- Sorts them using only stack operations (push, swap, rotate, reverse rotate).  
- Aims to use the minimum number of operations possible.  
- Produces a visualisation of the steps (optional).

## Why it matters  
It’s not just “write a sort” — it’s about designing an algorithm under constraints. I learnt:  
- how to optimise operations and data structures  
- analysis of time/space trade-offs  
- code readability under constraint (“limited commands”)  
- precision and testing for edge cases (big numbers, duplicates, invalid input)  

## Tech stack
